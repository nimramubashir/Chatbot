# ðŸ¤– Chatbot with Streamlit and OpenAI
This project features a dynamic chatbot application built with Streamlit and powered by the OpenAI API. The chatbot allows users to engage in interactive conversations by asking questions and receiving intelligent responses generated by OpenAI's language models.

To run the application, get an OpenAI API Key in the app.py file, add the api key, and then execute the following commands:
```
source lavender/bin/activate
streamlit run app.py
```

The Chatbot will send a request to open ai with your prompt and then display the response.
